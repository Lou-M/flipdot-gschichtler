`flipdot-gschichtler` allows to display text on the OpenLab's
flipdot panel in an user- and machine-friendly way without
fear of interfering with others and without requiring direct
connectivity to the panel.

Components
----------

`flipdot-gschichtler` consists of the following three components:

- `warteraum` manages a queue of text snippets which is accessible and
  manipulable via a public REST API. Users will directly or indirectly
  use it to send text to the flipdot panel.
- `anzeigetafel` is a daemon which runs on a machine with direct
  connectivity to the flipdot panel. It monitors the queue of
  `warteraum` and displays new incoming text on the panel and
  deletes it from the queue afterwards.
- `bahnhofshalle` is a web fronted which allows users to view and
  manipulate the queue of `warteraum` from their browser.

API Documentation
-----------------

Caveats
~~~~~~~

Current form parsing is somewhat limited. Make sure you don't
send any extra unnecessary form fields in your request body or
`warteraum` may refuse to cooperate with you.

The `v2` API may support `application/json` request bodies in
the future. This is not yet the case.

Any endpoint may also return different status codes than the
ones listed here in unusual cases. These would typically
be codes like 500 or 502.

API `v2`
~~~~~~~~

GET `/api/v2/queue`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|=============================================
| Request Content-Type  | none
| Response Content-Type | `application/json`
| Authentication        | no
|=============================================

This endpoint returns the current queue in the
following JSON format. `length` corresponds with
the length of the queue array. `queue` is ordered
by time of each item's addition, i. e. the first
item is next up to be displayed. The supplied `id`
may be used to delete the entries via the `del`
endpoint.

-------------------------
{
  "queue": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "world"
    },
    {
      "id": 0,
      "text": "hello"
    }
  ],
  "length": 2
}
-------------------------

|====================================
| HTTP Status  | Meaning
| 200          | Success
|====================================

POST `/api/v2/queue/add`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|=============================================
| Request Content-Type  | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
| Response Content-Type | `application/json`
| Authentication        | no
|=============================================

This endpoints allows you to add text to the queue,
it requires no authentication as it is a feature
available to the public. There is also no rate
limiting as of yet, but it may be implemented should
it become necessary (hopefully not).

The endpointed expects an urlencoded form as request
body with the following field.

|=============================================
| `text` | text to be added to the queue
|=============================================

The response contains the queue entry consisting
of its `text` and `id`:

----------------------
{
  "id": 3,
  "text": "hello"
}
----------------------

|=============================================
| HTTP Status  | Meaning
| 200          | Success, text added
| 400          | Illegal method or malformed request
|=============================================

DELETE `/api/v2/queue/<id>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|=============================================
| Request Content-Type  | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
| Response Content-Type | none
| Authentication        | yes (see below)
|=============================================

This endpoint can be used to delete queue entries, e. g. after
they have been displayed on the panel. The request should send
a form with the following fields as request body in order to
authenticate itself:

|=============================================
| `token` | API token of the application
|=============================================

|=============================================
| HTTP Status  | Meaning
| 204          | Success, queue entry deleted
| 400          | Illegal method or malformed request
| 401          | Unauthorized API token
| 404          | No queue entry with given `id`
|=============================================

API `v1`
~~~~~~~

GET `/api/v1/queue`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as `/api/v2/queue`, since v2 didn't introduce any changes.

POST `/api/v1/queue/add`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|=============================================
| Request Content-Type  | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
| Response Content-Type | `text/html`
| Authentication        | no
|=============================================

This is the legacy endpoint to add text to the queue. It enabled
interacting with it via a `<form>` in the old web app. The form
sent as part of the request should have the following fields:

|=============================================
| `text` | text to be added to the queue
|=============================================

The response format has been changed since the previous implementation.
I sincerly hope that nobody scraped the resulting page.

|=============================================
| HTTP Status  | Meaning
| 200          | Success, text added
| 400          | Illegal method or malformed request
|=============================================

DELETE `/api/v1/queue/del/<id>`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as `/api/v2/queue/<id>`, `v2` only changed the endpoint URL.

Bug Bounty

Contributing
------------

Help is welcome! Some things that remain to do:

* More ‚Äúfunny‚Äù bits for the web frontend
  (hint: see `const subjects` in `main.es6`)
* Make `warteraum` accept `application/json` request bodies for the `v2`
  API using http://www.catb.org/~esr/microjson/[microjson] (?).
* Polish the web frontend, test across browsers
* Improve font rendering on the flipdots, add emoji support
* A completely new feature you thought of

Legacy
------

Previously flipdot-gschichtler was based mostly on Python and Flask.
You can check out the
https://github.com/openlab-aux/flipdot-gschichtler/tree/1.0.0[old code]
still by browsing the `1.0.0` tag.
